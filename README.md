# Walk-In-Attendance

This is one of the plausible approach for automatic attendance system with Human - Device mapping.
The idea is to assign a static IP to the Campus wide network. All employees upon entering campus network will be marked present and their live location could also be tracked.

Modules used: ESP8266,IP Web Camera

For making the IP static refer this article : https://circuits4you.com/2018/03/09/esp8266-static-ip-address-arduino-example/
Future Work:
Human - Automobile Mapping with Automatic Number Plate Recognition
